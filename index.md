## ðŸ”¹ Project 1 â€” Apply Filters to SQL Queries


Category: Cybersecurity / Data Analysis



Project Description


This project demonstrates how I applied SQL queries with filters to investigate potential security incidents and update employee systems. I worked with system log and employee data to identify unusual login activity and determine which employee machines required updates.

Key Tasks & Examples


ðŸ”¹ Investigated After-Hours Failed Logins


Wrote SQL queries to filter failed login attempts that occurred after 18:00. This allowed me to identify suspicious after-hours access patterns.

ðŸ”¹ Analyzed Logins on Specific Dates


Queried login data for suspicious events that occurred on 2022-05-08 and 2022-05-09. I used logical operators (OR) to filter for multiple dates at once.

ðŸ”¹ Detected Foreign Login Attempts


Retrieved all login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico using a NOT LIKE 'MEX%' filter. This helped isolate unusual geographic login activity.

ðŸ”¹ Identified Employees for Security Updates
Pulled employee machines from the Marketing department (East building).

Retrieved employees in Finance OR Sales departments.

Retrieved employees not in IT to apply specialized updates.

SQL Techniques Used
Filtering with WHERE clauses

Logical operators: AND, OR, NOT

Pattern matching with LIKE and wildcards (%)

Querying across multiple tables: log_in_attempts, employees

Outcome


This project highlights my ability to apply SQL to real-world cybersecurity use cases such as:

Investigating failed login attempts

Detecting abnormal login activity

Supporting IT teams with system updates


It demonstrates both technical SQL query skills and practical security problem-solving. 

## ðŸ”¹ Project 2 â€” IP Allow List Automation Project


Description:

I developed a Python algorithm to automate management of restricted content access by updating the allow_list.txt file. This script ensures that outdated or unauthorized IP addresses are removed, maintaining secure access controls.



Key Steps

1. Open the allow list file

Used with open(import_file, "r") to safely read the file.
Ensured the file was automatically closed after reading.

2. Read file contents



Applied .read() to convert the IP addresses into a string.
Stored results in a variable for further processing.

3. Convert string to list



Used .split() to separate the IP addresses into list format.
Allowed easy removal of specific IPs later.

4. Iterate through the remove list



Implemented a for loop to check each IP address in remove_list.
Conditional logic ensured only valid entries were processed.

5. Remove unauthorized IPs



Applied .remove() method to delete IPs from the allow list.
Prevented access for flagged addresses.

6. Update and overwrite file

Converted list back into a string using .join().
Rewrote the allow_list.txt file with updated IPs using open(..., "w").

Final Outcome

This project automated the process of maintaining a secure allow list. The script successfully:

Removed unauthorized IP addresses.
Rewrote the file with updated entries.
Ensured restricted content is only accessible to approved IPs 


ðŸ”¹ Project 3 â€” Packet Analysis (Wireshark) 


ðŸ”¹Capture of all my devices pinged (network topology consists of three servers (webserver, fileserver, utilserver) and a workstation (h1).)  

#Looking at ARP traffic.A good way to discover all live hosts on a network. Close analysis of these packets can lead to discoveries of nefarious behaviors such as MAC spoofing, MITM attacks, and NAC (Network Access Control) failures.

ðŸ”¹Hunted for unsecured protocols and found telnet being used which contained a username and password in plain text. :)
