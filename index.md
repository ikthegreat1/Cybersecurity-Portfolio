## ðŸ”¹ Project 1 â€” Apply Filters to SQL Queries


Category: Cybersecurity / Data Analysis



Project Description


This project demonstrates how I applied SQL queries with filters to investigate potential security incidents and update employee systems. I worked with system log and employee data to identify unusual login activity and determine which employee machines required updates.

Key Tasks & Examples


ðŸ”¹ Investigated After-Hours Failed Logins


Wrote SQL queries to filter failed login attempts that occurred after 18:00. This allowed me to identify suspicious after-hours access patterns.

ðŸ”¹ Analyzed Logins on Specific Dates


Queried login data for suspicious events that occurred on 2022-05-08 and 2022-05-09. I used logical operators (OR) to filter for multiple dates at once.

ðŸ”¹ Detected Foreign Login Attempts


Retrieved all login attempts that occurred outside of Mexico using a NOT LIKE 'MEX%' filter. This helped isolate unusual geographic login activity.

ðŸ”¹ Identified Employees for Security Updates
Pulled employee machines from the Marketing department (East building).

Retrieved employees in Finance OR Sales departments.

Retrieved employees not in IT to apply specialized updates.

SQL Techniques Used
Filtering with WHERE clauses

Logical operators: AND, OR, NOT

Pattern matching with LIKE and wildcards (%)

Querying across multiple tables: log_in_attempts, employees

Outcome


This project highlights my ability to apply SQL to real-world cybersecurity use cases such as:

Investigating failed login attempts

Detecting abnormal login activity

Supporting IT teams with system updates



It demonstrates both technical SQL query skills and practical security problem-solving.
